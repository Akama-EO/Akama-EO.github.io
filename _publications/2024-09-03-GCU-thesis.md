Chest X-ray (CXR) is one of the most used diagnostic tools in medical practice, providing crucial insights into the condition of a patient's lungs and thoracic cavity. Despite their widespread use, the interpretation of CXR images remains a challenging task, often requiring significant expertise and experience. 

Traditional methods of interpreting CXR images by radiologists, while essential, have proven to be time-consuming and prone to human error, particularly under the increased strain and workload brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic era. In response to these challenges, this dissertation investigates the application of deep learning techniques for the development of automated systems to assist radiologists with the detection and classification of abnormalities on CXR images with the aim to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

The study employs the benchmark dataset used for the RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge to train and validate region-based proposal network models, specifically the Mask R-CNN model. Various data preprocessing and augmentation techniques are used to ensure robust and generalized model performance. The results from this study highlight the strength of region-based convolution neural networks, specifically the Mask R-CNN model, providing valuable insights into their practical implementation in medical image analysis. â€ƒ
