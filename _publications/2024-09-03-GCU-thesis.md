Chest X-ray (CXR) is one of the most used diagnostic tools in medical practice, providing crucial insights into the condition of a patient's lungs and thoracic cavity. Despite their widespread use, the interpretation of CXR images remains a challenging task, often requiring significant expertise and experience. 
Traditional methods of interpreting CXR images by radiologists, while essential, have proven to be time-consuming and prone to human error, particularly under the increased strain and workload brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic era. In response to these challenges, this dissertation investigates the application of deep learning techniques for the development of automated systems to assist radiologists with the detection and classification of abnormalities on CXR images with the aim to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.
