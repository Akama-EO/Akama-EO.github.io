I'm a Data Analyst, Business Intelligence, and Big Data Engineer with the last two years spent between these roles. 

In my current role, I specialize in transforming diverse and complex datasets into actionable insights, enabling organizations to make informed, data-driven decisions.

With a strong background in professional services technical consultant, I have built a unique blend of competencies and technical expertise to understand diverse client needs and deliver tailored solutions that drive success. 

Feel free to take a look at my [Resume](/cv/), [Portfolio](/portfolio/), [Blog](/year-archive/) and [Publication](/publications/) sections. Thank you.
